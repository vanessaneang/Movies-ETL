# Movies-ETL

## Overview

In this project the puprose was to the ETL proccess to extract movie data from Wikipedia, Kaggle, and MovieLens. From there the data was transformed to create a more concise and useful data table and load the resulting table to PostgresSQL database. I found this project a bit challenging for me and was unable to load the ratings table into PostgresSQL.
